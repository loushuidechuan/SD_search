It allows you to perform calculations with lower precision (half-precision or BF16) for certain parts of the model that can tolerate it, while using full-precision (FP32) for the rest. This can speed up training time without sacrificing model accuracy. The available options for mixed precision are No, FP16, and BF16 (for newer GPUs)."
